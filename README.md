# an-untitled-clicker-game
One of my first Python Tkinter projects, featuring none other than ice-cream!

Information:

UCG = untitled clicker game
UCG is not crossplatform. It only works on PC.
Anti-cheat systems are in development currently.

Feel free to download and play the game. The Github will have updated versions however, so you can run it from Github.
