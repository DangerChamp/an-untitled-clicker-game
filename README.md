# an-untitled-clicker-game
One of my first Python Tkinter projects, featuring none other than ice-cream!

## Downloading Information
The file name for any version of the game in the releases tab is `v0.0.release/patched.py`
To run the game normally (just clicking on it), you need Python 3.10 or later. If you wish to run it on Python 3.9 or earlier, please open the Python 3.9 IDLE application, then open the game file.

## Other info

UCG = untitled clicker game

UCG is not crossplatform. It only works on the Windows operating system.

Feel free to download via the releases feature and play the game. The Github will have updated versions of the game for you to check out.
